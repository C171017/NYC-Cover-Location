            <h2>Billy Joel - 52nd Street</h2>
            <p>
                The cover for Billy Joel's <em>52nd Street</em> was shot on the corner of 52nd Street and 6th Avenue in New York City. This location is significant because 52nd Street was once known as "Swing Street," famous for its jazz clubs and musicians.
